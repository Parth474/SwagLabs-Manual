# SauceDemo (Swag Labs) – Manual Testing Project

## Project Overview
This project represents a complete manual testing effort performed on the SauceDemo (Swag Labs) e-commerce web application. 
The goal of this project is to apply real-world software testing concepts, validate core application functionality, identify defects, and maintain proper test documentation following standard QA practices.

The application was tested from a user perspective, covering major workflows such as login, product browsing, cart operations, checkout, and order confirmation.

---

## Objective
- To understand and apply the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)
- To design and execute manual test cases for a web application
- To identify and report defects clearly using Jira
- To verify application stability using smoke and integration testing
- To maintain proper test documentation and traceability

---

## Application Under Test
- Application Name: SauceDemo (Swag Labs)
- Application Type: E-commerce Web Application
- URL: https://www.saucedemo.com

---

## Modules Covered
- User Authentication (Login and Logout)
- Product Listing
- Product Sorting and Filtering
- Shopping Cart
- Checkout Process
- Order Confirmation
- Product Details Page

---

## Types of Testing Performed
- Smoke Testing to verify build stability
- Integration Testing to validate interaction between modules
- System Testing to verify complete application functionality
- Partial Regression Testing to ensure stability after changes

---

## Test Artifacts
The following test documents were created as part of this project:
- Test Plan
- Test Scenarios
- Test Cases
- Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)
- Bug Report
- Test Execution Report
- Test Summary Report

All documents are maintained separately and follow industry-standard formats.

---

## Defect Management
Defects identified during testing were logged and tracked using Jira. Each defect includes clear steps to reproduce, expected result, actual result, severity, and priority. 
Issues were linked to corresponding test cases to maintain traceability. Known issues were observed for specific test users and documented accordingly.

---

## Tools Used
- Manual Testing
- Jira (Test and Defect Management)
- GitHub (Version Control and Documentation)
- MS Excel (Test Case Design and Reporting)

---

## Test Execution Summary
All planned test cases were executed successfully. Core application flows such as login, product selection, cart management, and checkout were validated. 
Defects identified during execution were documented and tracked until closure. Test results were summarized using a Test Summary Report.

---

## Key Learnings
- Gained hands-on experience in end-to-end manual testing
- Improved understanding of test case design and execution
- Practical exposure to defect reporting and tracking
- Experience working with Agile testing practices
- Better understanding of real-world QA workflows

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a structured approach to manual testing of a web application. It reflects practical knowledge of software testing concepts, clear documentation practices, and professional defect management aligned with industry standards.
